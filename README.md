# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Prediction

## Project Overview

An **end-to-end machine learning project** focused on predicting employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The project demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment-ready insights.

Key components include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and uncovering actionable insights.
* **Model Building:** Experimented with multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective approach.
* **Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Applied Stratified K-Fold cross-validation and Randomized Search for model optimization.
* **Final Model:** Gradient Boosting Classifier selected based on performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
